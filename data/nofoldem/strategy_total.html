		These tables tell you when to fold cards that have a lesser than average chance of winning (including ties). If the blinds are high, you might want to play tighter.
		<p>
		In an n-player game, with hole cards XY (where Y is the higher card), Look at
		the column for Y and the row for n. For example, let's say you're in a 5 player game. If your hole cards
		are suited, refer to the first table. If your highest card is a 9, then the table tells you that your lower card must be at least
		a 5. If your hole cards are unsuited, refer to the second table. If your highest card is a T (ten), then your lowest card must
		be at least a 7. A "*" means that all low cards are playable, and is equivalent to 2. For example, always play hole cards with an A. A "-" means you should fold. For
		example, fold suited cards with high card 3 if there are 8 or fewer players.

So in summary, here's a reasonable folding strategy in my opinion for low blinds (you have to tighten up depending on the blinds and your stack):<p>
Unsuited - Stay in if both cards are 7 or better, although 10 or better is preferable. Play all pairs<br>
Suited - Stay in if you have any card that is a 10 or better, otherwise if the cards are "close enough" (the lower the cards, the closer they need to be)<br>
Play lame hands once in a while or if blinds are really low
