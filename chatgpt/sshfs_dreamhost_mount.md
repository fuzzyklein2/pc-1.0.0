# SSHFS DreamHost Mount Conversation

## User:
Look into sshfs for me.

## ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here's a clear overview of `sshfs`:

---

### 🔧 What is `sshfs`?

`sshfs` stands for **SSH File System**. It allows you to mount a remote filesystem over SSH, so you can interact with files on another machine **as if they were local**, using the standard SSH protocol.

It uses **FUSE** (Filesystem in Userspace) to provide this functionality, meaning:
- You don’t need root on your local machine to mount it.
- The remote machine only needs to have an SSH server (no special setup).

---

### ✅ Use Cases

- Access files on a remote server securely without copying them.
- Work on code, configs, or data remotely from your local editor.
- Great for developers, sysadmins, or when working with servers without full NFS/Samba setup.

---

### 📦 Installing `sshfs`

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install sshfs
```

#### On Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install sshfs
```

#### On macOS (via Homebrew):
```bash
brew install sshfs
```
> Note: macOS support may also require `osxfuse`.

---

### 🔌 Basic Usage

```bash
sshfs user@remote:/path/to/dir /local/mount/point
```

Example:
```bash
sshfs alice@192.168.1.100:/home/alice /mnt/remote-alice
```

---

### 🛑 Unmounting

On Linux:
```bash
fusermount -u /local/mount/point
```

On macOS:
```bash
umount /local/mount/point
```

---

### ⚙️ Options You Might Use

- `-o reconnect` — Reconnect on disconnection.
- `-o allow_other` — Allow other users on the system to access the mount.
- `-o IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa` — Use a specific private key.
- `-o default_permissions` — Enforce permission checks locally.

Example:
```bash
sshfs -o reconnect,allow_other,IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@host:/data /mnt/data
```

---

### 🚫 Limitations

- Performance is limited by SSH and network speed.
- Not ideal for high-frequency file operations (e.g., databases).
- May have trouble with file locking or some advanced filesystem features.
- Requires `fuse` to be available and permitted (sometimes disabled in containers).

## User:
How do I make a mount point? Will any local directory do as long as it's empty?

## ChatGPT:
Yes, exactly — any **empty local directory** will work as a mount point for `sshfs`.

---

### ✅ To create a mount point:

```bash
mkdir ~/remote-mount
```

This creates an empty directory called `remote-mount` in your home folder, which you can then mount with `sshfs`.

---

### 📝 Example `sshfs` Mount Command:

```bash
sshfs user@remote:/path/to/dir ~/remote-mount
```

Make sure:
- `~/remote-mount` exists and is empty.
- `user@remote` is accessible via SSH.
- You have permissions on the remote directory.

---

### 🔄 Reuse

You don’t need a new mount point every time — just reuse that same directory. But:
- If the directory already has something mounted, you need to **unmount** it first before mounting again.
- You should **not write directly** to the mount point while it's mounted unless you're writing to the remote system through the mount.

---

## User:
I want to sshfs my Web space at DreamHost. I have a folder, ~/Public/fuzzyklein.net as a mount point (it's empty). Give me the command line.

## ChatGPT:
Great — since you already have an empty folder `~/Public/fuzzyklein.net`, you're all set to mount your DreamHost web space using `sshfs`.

---

### 🔐 DreamHost SSH Info

You'll need the following details from your DreamHost panel:
- **SSH username**
- **DreamHost server name** (like `shell.example.com`)
- **Remote path** (usually your website’s root is like `/home/username/fuzzyklein.net`)

Let’s assume:
- Your DreamHost SSH username is `fuzzy`
- Your DreamHost server is `shell.dreamhost.com`
- The remote path is `/home/fuzzy/fuzzyklein.net`

---

### ✅ `sshfs` Command

```bash
sshfs fuzzy@shell.dreamhost.com:/home/fuzzy/fuzzyklein.net ~/Public/fuzzyklein.net
```

This mounts your DreamHost web space into your local folder.

---

### 🛠 Optional but Useful Flags

```bash
sshfs -o reconnect,IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa fuzzy@shell.dreamhost.com:/home/fuzzy/fuzzyklein.net ~/Public/fuzzyklein.net
```

- `-o reconnect`: auto-reconnect if the connection drops
- `-o IdentityFile=...`: specify your SSH private key if you're using one

---

### 🛑 To Unmount

```bash
fusermount -u ~/Public/fuzzyklein.net     # Linux
```

```bash
umount ~/Public/fuzzyklein.net            # macOS
```

## ChatGPT:
If you're getting:

```
read: Connection reset by peer
```

when using `sshfs`, it means the remote server (DreamHost) is **closing the SSH connection immediately**. This could be due to a few common issues:

---

### 🔍 1. **SSH Access Not Enabled**
DreamHost doesn't enable SSH by default for users.

✅ **Fix**:
- Go to the DreamHost panel.
- Navigate to **Manage Users** → Find your user.
- Make sure the user is set to type: **Shell (SSH)**, not **FTP**.

---

### 🔍 2. **Wrong Hostname**
DreamHost assigns a **specific shell server name** per user — not `shell.dreamhost.com`.

✅ **Fix**:
- In the DreamHost panel, go to **Manage Domains** → find your domain.
- Look for **"Web Server"** or SSH hostname info.
- It might look like `ps123456.dreamhostps.com` or `serendipity.dreamhost.com`.

Try to `ssh` manually first:

```bash
ssh fuzzy@your-server.dreamhost.com
```

If that fails, `sshfs` definitely will.

---

### 🔍 3. **Firewall or Port Block**
Rare, but some networks block outgoing SSH.

✅ **Fix**: Test from a different network or try:

```bash
ssh -v fuzzy@your-server.dreamhost.com
```

That will give you a verbose log of what’s happening.

---

### 🔍 4. **Incorrect Remote Path**
If your path is wrong, DreamHost might allow the connection and immediately close it after failure to find the home dir.

✅ Use:

```bash
ssh fuzzy@your-server.dreamhost.com
pwd
```

Use the result of `pwd` as your remote path in `sshfs`.

Would you like to paste your exact `sshfs` command (with obfuscation if needed) so I can confirm it looks correct?
