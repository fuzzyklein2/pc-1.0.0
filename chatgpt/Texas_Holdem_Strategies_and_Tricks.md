## 🎯 Strategic Tricks & Tactics

### 1. Steal the Blinds from Late Position
When everyone folds to you in the cutoff or button, raise with a wide range. Blinds often fold without a strong hand. Mix in strong hands to balance your range.

### 2. Float the Flop to Steal the Turn
Call a continuation bet with a weak hand or draw, and if they check the turn, bet. Many players give up on the turn if they miss.

## 🧠 Bluff-Catching

### What Is Bluff-Catching?
Calling a river bet with a medium-strength hand, expecting the opponent to be bluffing. You're not beating value hands — you're beating air.

### When to Bluff-Catch
- Board has missed draws
- Opponent’s line doesn’t make sense
- You block value hands

### Key Factors
- **Board Texture:** Were draws completed?
- **Bet Sizing:** Overbets can be polarized (nuts or nothing)
- **Player Type:** Aggro = more bluff potential

## 🕹️ Bluff-Catching Hand Example

**Hand:** A♣ 9♠ on Button  
**Board:** 9♦ 6♠ 3♥ Q♣ 2♠  
Villain leads river after passive play — you call with top pair and win vs T♦ 8♣ (missed gutshot). Classic bluff-catch.
