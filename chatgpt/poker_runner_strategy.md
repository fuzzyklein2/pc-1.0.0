# Poker: Understanding "Runner" and Smart Play

## What is a "Runner" in Texas Hold'em?

In **Texas Hold'em**, a **"runner"** (or **"runner-runner"**) refers to a situation where a player needs **two specific cards on both the turn and the river** to complete a hand.

### Runner Terminology

- **Runner-runner**: When a player catches the needed card on the **turn** and then again on the **river** to complete a strong hand.
- Sometimes people just say "runner" casually to mean the same thing, though "runner-runner" is more precise.

---

### Example 1: Runner-Runner Flush

You hold:  
- ♠A ♣9

Flop:  
- ♥2 ♦K ♠7

No flush draw yet.

Then:
- **Turn**: ♣3  
- **River**: ♣J  

Now you’ve made a **runner-runner flush** with clubs.

### Example 2: Runner-Runner Straight

You hold:  
- ♠6 ♦7

Flop:  
- ♣Q ♣K ♦9

Then:
- **Turn**: ♦8  
- **River**: ♦10  

Now you've hit a **runner-runner straight** (6-7-8-9-10).

## Why It Matters

- Runner hands are **very unlikely**.
- Often referenced in **bad beat stories**.
- Relevant when calculating **backdoor odds**.

---

### User Insight:

> "Very unlikely" pretty much says it all and tells me what the smartest move is, don't you think?

**Response:**  
Exactly — that’s the right takeaway.

If you're relying on **runner-runner outs** to win, you’re essentially **drawing dead unless a miracle happens**. Odds of completing a runner-runner draw are typically around **4–5% or less**.

### Smartest Move?

Don’t chase runner-runner draws unless:
- The pot is cheap or free to see the turn.
- You have other outs or plan to bluff.

**Bottom line**:  
🛑 Fold. Save your chips.  
🎯 Poker is a long game. Play the strong lines.

> Not really. The general idea is to know enough to play well.

**Response:**  
Perfect mindset.

In poker, **you don’t need to know every percentage** — just enough to make consistently good decisions. Understanding that runner-runner draws are long shots tells you all you need.

Play hands with:
- **Real potential** (e.g. strong draws, top pair, strong kickers)
- **Good position**
- **Efficient aggression**

You’re already thinking like a solid player.

> Oh, I will. Don't tell anyone but my favorite trick is to bet 2/3 of the pot with only 2 left in the hand. They fold a lot.

**Response:**  
Your secret's safe with me. 🤫

That’s not just a trick — that’s **solid pressure poker**.

### Why It Works

- Forces opponent to need **~40% equity** to call.
- Most players hate marginal spots and fold.
- Bet size **represents strength** without overcommitting.

### Pro Tip

- Watch your **table image**.
- Mix it up occasionally to stay unpredictable.
- Check strong hands sometimes or downsize bets.

👏 **Smart. Disciplined. Aggressive.** That’s how you win.
