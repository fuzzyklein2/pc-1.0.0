# Conversation Log: web-ext and NPM Troubleshooting

**Date:** June 23, 2025

**User:**  
I got this error using npm to install web-ext:

**Assistant:**  
Sure, I can help you with that ‚Äî but first, could you please paste the **exact error message** you received while trying to install `web-ext` using `npm`? This will help me identify the cause and guide you precisely.

Also, please let me know:
1. What command did you run? (e.g., `npm install -g web-ext`)
2. Are you running this on macOS, Linux, or Windows?

**User:**  
npm WARN deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3: Use @eslint/object-schema instead  
npm WARN deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory...  
npm WARN deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported  
npm WARN deprecated rimraf@3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported  
npm WARN deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0: Use @eslint/config-array instead  
npm WARN deprecated eslint@8.57.1: This version is no longer supported...

**Assistant:**  
Thanks! The output you shared contains only **warnings**, not errors ‚Äî which means the installation likely still succeeded despite these notices.

### üîé Summary of Warnings

| Warning Type | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| `deprecated` packages | These libraries are outdated and replaced by newer ones. | ‚ö†Ô∏è No immediate action unless you're maintaining the package. |
| `inflight`, `glob`, `rimraf`, `eslint`, etc. | These are dependencies of `web-ext` or its dependencies. | You can't directly fix this unless you're contributing to the packages. |

### ‚úÖ What You Should Do

1. **Check if `web-ext` was installed successfully:**

   Run:
   ```bash
   web-ext --version
   ```

   If it prints a version, you're good to go.

2. If it **didn't install**, please provide:
   - Any **error message** shown after the warnings (errors usually say `ERR!`)
   - Output of:
     ```bash
     npm -v && node -v
     ```

Would you like me to suggest an alternative way to install `web-ext` (e.g., using `npx` or local install) if you're still having issues?

**User:**  
No, no, I guess the warnings might have just pertained to npm. How do I update that? I used the Software Manager in Linux Mint to install it. Is it too far behind?

**Assistant:**  
Great question ‚Äî yes, if you installed `npm` via the **Software Manager** in Linux Mint, it's very likely to be **outdated**, since that method uses the distro's package repositories, which lag behind.

### ‚úÖ Check Current Versions

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
node -v && npm -v
```

Let‚Äôs say you see something like `v12.x` for Node and `6.x` for npm ‚Äî that‚Äôs definitely too old for modern tooling like `web-ext`.

### ‚úÖ Safest Way to Update on Linux Mint

#### 1. Install `nvm` (if you haven‚Äôt already):

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Then run:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

#### 2. Install latest Node.js and npm:

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

#### 3. Check versions again:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see something like Node `v20.x` and npm `10.x`.

**User:**  
v18.19.1  
9.2.0

**Assistant:**  
Perfect ‚Äî your versions:

- **Node.js**: `v18.19.1` ‚úÖ (LTS and still supported)
- **npm**: `9.2.0` ‚úÖ (not latest, but solid and compatible with `web-ext`)

You're in a good place ‚Äî **no urgent need to upgrade**. The deprecation warnings you saw earlier are just coming from packages that `web-ext` depends on, and those maintainers need to update their internals (not you).

Would you like help creating a minimal `web-ext` config or starting your extension project?

**User:**  
Yeah, I'm working on that and playing poker at the same time. I'm about $25 ahead for the night, too. :)

**Assistant:**  
Nice! Multitasking like a pro ‚Äî coding browser extensions *and* raking in chips üÉèüíªüí∞

If you hit a blocker with `web-ext` or want a hand scaffolding a basic Firefox extension, just say the word.

**User:**  
*(screenshot showing address bar with red-eyed robot icon)*  
Hey, I used web-ext to run an example extension from Mozilla and my address bar in the browser window it's running looks like this. Kinda like a problem. Is it?

**Assistant:**  
Nice catch ‚Äî that little **robot icon with red eyes** in your address bar means **you're running Firefox with a temporary, unsigned extension** loaded via `web-ext`.

### üß† What It Means

- It's **normal** and expected behavior when you use `web-ext run`.
- Firefox shows that warning-style icon to indicate:
  - The extension isn‚Äôt signed by Mozilla.
  - It‚Äôs temporarily loaded in a debug/dev profile.
- It does **not** indicate an error or issue unless you're distributing the extension.

You're totally fine to keep developing with that robot buddy watching over you ü§ñ.
