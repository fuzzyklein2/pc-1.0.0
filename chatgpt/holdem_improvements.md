Can you list for me all the hands that a pair after the flop in Texas Holdem can improve to, and the probability of that happening by the turn or the river? Then can you also do the same for 2 pair, 3 of a kind, a straight, a flush, etc... ?

Sure! Let's go hand-by-hand and see how each hand after the flop in Texas Hold'em can improve by the turn or river, along with approximate probabilities.

    Assumptions:

        You see the flop and are holding the hand described.

        We'll calculate chances of improving by the river, unless otherwise stated.

        Probabilities assume all outs are live and no blockers.

        For simplicity, we don’t factor in board pairing or opponent action (i.e., no complex equity modeling).

🂡 One Pair

You're holding one pair after the flop.

Can improve to:
Hand	How it happens	Approx. Chance by River
Two Pair	One of your other hole cards pairs	~26%
Three of a Kind	One of your pair cards hits again	~8.4%
Full House	Trips + board pairs, or pair + trips	~0.9%
Four of a Kind	Two more of the same rank	~0.25%
🂡🂱 Two Pair

You're holding two pair after the flop.

Can improve to:
Hand	How it happens	Approx. Chance by River
Full House	One of your pair cards hits again	~16.5%
Four of a Kind	Two more of one rank (very rare)	~0.25%
🂡🂡🂡 Three of a Kind (Set)

You're holding a set after the flop.

Can improve to:
Hand	How it happens	Approx. Chance by River
Full House	Board pairs or you hit your kicker	~33.4%
Four of a Kind	Hit the 4th card of that rank	~4.3%
🂡🂢🂣🂤🂥 Straight

You have a straight after the flop.

Can improve to:
Hand	How it happens	Approx. Chance by River
Flush	Only if you're on a straight flush draw	Varies — see below
Full House	If board pairs and you match	Very low
Straight Flush	Need 2 suited cards, perfect run	~0.3% (if possible)

    You usually don’t improve a made straight significantly, unless you're also on a flush draw or board pairs.

🂡🂱🂹🂽🃁 Flush

You have a made flush on the flop.

Can improve to:
Hand	How it happens	Approx. Chance by River
Straight Flush	Only if you also have a straight draw	~1%
Full House	If board pairs twice	~0.3%
Four of a Kind	If you have pocket pair that hits	~0% (depends on hand)
🂡🂡🂡🂡 Four of a Kind

You flop quads.

Can improve to:
Hand	How it happens	Approx. Chance
No improvement	You can’t really improve. Best hand possible	N/A
🂡🂱🂢🂣🂤 (Straight Flush) or 🂡🂡🂡🂡🂡 (Royal Flush)

Already best possible hands. No improvement possible.

I can add open-ended straight draws, flush draws, or gutshot probabilities, or simulate equity for real hands. Let me know!

Yes, add all those. Also add another column to the table showing the Chance By River column values converted to odds against improvement.

Absolutely! Let’s enhance the table with:

    All major drawing hands after the flop:

        Open-ended straight draw (OESD)

        Gutshot straight draw

        Flush draw

        Combo draws

    A new column showing "Odds Against" (i.e., how many times it won’t happen for each time it does).

🔢 Odds Conversion Formula

To convert probability to "odds against":
Odds Against=(1−PP)
Odds Against=(P1−P​)

Where PP is the chance as a decimal (e.g. 0.20 for 20%). We'll round to the nearest tenth.
✅ Complete Hand Improvement Table (Post-Flop)
Starting Hand	Possible Improvements	Chance by River	Odds Against
One Pair	Two Pair	~26%	~2.8:1
	Three of a Kind	~8.4%	~10.9:1
	Full House	~0.9%	~110:1
	Four of a Kind	~0.25%	~399:1
Two Pair	Full House	~16.5%	~5.1:1
	Four of a Kind	~0.25%	~399:1
Three of a Kind (Set)	Full House	~33.4%	~2.0:1

Straight	Straight Flush (if suited)	~0.3%	~332:1
	Full House (rare)	~0.1%	~999:1
Flush	Straight Flush (if suited & connected)	~1%	~99:1
	Full House (if board pairs twice)	~0.3%	~332:1
Full House	Four of a Kind	~2%	~49:1
Four of a Kind	None (already near-maximum)	—	—
Open-ended Straight Draw	Made Straight	~31.5%	~2.2:1
Gutshot Straight Draw	Made Straight	~16.5%	~5.1:1
Flush Draw (4 to a Flush)	Made Flush	~35%	~1.86:1
Combo Draw (Flush + OESD)	Straight or Flush (at least one)	~54%	~0.85:1
📌 Notes

    Open-ended Straight Draw (OESD): 8 outs × 2 cards to come = ~31.5%

    Gutshot Draw: 4 outs × 2 cards to come = ~16.5%

    Flush Draw (4 to flush): 9 outs × 2 cards = ~35%

    Combo Draw (Flush + OESD): 15 outs = 54% (this is a huge draw)

These are raw improvement chances. Real equity may differ depending on the board texture, blockers, and opponent hands.
