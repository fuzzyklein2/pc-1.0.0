# Poker Affiliate Program Conversation

## User:
Can you find out if Clubs Poker has an affiliate marketing program?

## ChatGPT:
Yes, **Clubs Poker does have an affiliate-style program**, but it's not a formal affiliate network like those used by content creators. Instead, it's structured as a **Refer‑a‑Friend program** directly within the app:

- **Rewards**: Up to **100,000,000 Gold Coins (GC)** and **10,000 Sweeps Coins (SC)**, with no limit on the number of friends you can refer.
- **How it works**:  
  1. Open the Clubs Poker app → go to **Profile** → select **Refer‑a‑Friend**.  
  2. Copy your unique referral link and share it.  
  3. When referred friends rake in ring‑game GC or SC, you earn a matching bonus — e.g., 100 GC per 100 GC raked, and 2 SC per 10 SC raked.
- **Payout duration**: Rewards from referred friends are credited up to 12 months after they join.
- **Terms**: Clubs Poker reserves the right to suspend or adjust awards if they detect abuse.

But there's no way to robotically refer friends that you've never met in your life by having them click a link on your web site or blog?

## ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right to question that — here's the key:

### 🔍 Clubs Poker's referral system is not built for robotic, public web-based referrals.
Their **Refer-a-Friend** program is designed for **personal sharing** within their app ecosystem, not public or automated affiliate-style outreach.

### 🚫 What You *Can't* Do:
- No public referral URL you can post on your blog or website that a stranger can just click and have it work automatically.
- No affiliate tracking, cookies, or signup analytics.

### ✅ What You *Can* Do:
- Share your referral link directly with someone (via email, messaging, or social).
- If someone installs the app via your link and starts playing, you earn rewards based on their gameplay.
- Some users post their links in forums or social platforms — this can work, but inconsistently.

### 🤖 Why You Can't Automate It Easily:
- Tracking is tied to **in-app activity**, not a web-based affiliate cookie.
- Even if someone clicks your link from a website:
  - They likely need to open it on a **mobile device**.
  - It redirects to the **app store**, and the referral may **fail** if the flow isn't perfect.

### 🧠 Workarounds:
1. Use a bridge page to give users clear instructions before launching the app.
2. Embed your link in social posts where people are used to mobile flows.
